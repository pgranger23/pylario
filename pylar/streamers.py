"""Sequential ROOT deserialiser for variable-length members.

:mod:`pylar.artio` decodes member-wise vectors as numpy slices, which is
fast but requires every member to have a fixed on-disk size.  That covers hits
and space points; it does not cover the products that carry containers --
``recob::Track`` (a trajectory of N points), ``recob::Shower``,
``recob::PFParticle``, ``simb::MCParticle``, ``recob::Wire``.

Those still arrive member-wise, so the columnar structure holds: what changes is
that a variable member's column cannot be strided over.  Empirically (verified
byte-exactly against dunesw output) such a column is written as::

    byte count (4) | version (2) | [count (4)][elements] x N objects

i.e. one header for the whole column, then a length-prefixed run per object.
This module walks that layout with a cursor instead of slicing it.

Nested objects carry their own byte-count prefix, which is read rather than
predicted -- so unlike the fast path this code never has to guess whether a
class uses a 6- or 10-byte header.
