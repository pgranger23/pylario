"""Pure-python reader for art-ROOT (LArSoft) event files.

art writes ``std::vector<T>`` data products *member-wise* (ROOT's
``kStreamedMemberWise`` bit, 0x4000).  uproot's automatic model assumes the
object-wise layout and raises ``ValueError: ... has the wrong number of bytes``,
so we decode the member-wise stream ourselves.

Member-wise is columnar: after the header, member 1 is stored contiguously for
all N objects, then member 2, and so on.  Decoding is therefore a handful of
numpy views with no per-object work, which is what makes an interactive display
practical without ROOT.

The layout is derived from the streamer info stored in the file itself, so this
generalises to any product whose members are PODs or nested POD structs
(recob::Hit, recob::SpacePoint, ...) rather than being hard-coded per class.

On-disk layout of one member-wise vector entry::

    byte count (4) | version|0x4000 (2) | value-class version (2) | N (4)
    [ member 1 for all N objects ][ member 2 for all N objects ] ...

A *flat* member's block is a plain contiguous array of N values.  A *nested
object* member (e.g. ``geo::WireID``) is written object-wise within its block,
and every class in its inheritance chain contributes a 6-byte
``(byte count, version)`` prefix -- so its sub-members are read with a stride.
